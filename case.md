## 📘 Theory Overview

Cyber incidents, such as data breaches and software vulnerabilities, pose significant threats to individuals, organizations, and governments in the digital age.

### 🛡️ Data Breaches

A **data breach** is a security incident in which sensitive, protected, or confidential data is accessed or used by unauthorized individuals. Common attack vectors include:

- **Phishing**: Deceptive emails tricking users into revealing credentials.
- **Malware**: Malicious software like ransomware that damages or encrypts data.
- **Insider Threats**: Employees or former employees misusing access.
- **Weak Security Practices**: Poor passwords, unpatched systems, etc.
- **Social Engineering**: Manipulating individuals to breach security.

**Impact**:
- Financial losses
- Reputational damage
- Legal consequences
- Loss of customer trust

### 🔍 Software Vulnerabilities

A **software vulnerability** is a flaw or weakness in software code or architecture that attackers can exploit. Vulnerability handling involves:

1. **Discovery**: Found by researchers or malicious actors.
2. **Disclosure**: Reported responsibly to vendors.
3. **Patching**: Fixes issued to mitigate risks.
4. **Exploitation**: Attackers target unpatched systems.

**Consequences**:
- Data theft
- System compromise
- Denial-of-service (DoS)
- Large-scale breaches
